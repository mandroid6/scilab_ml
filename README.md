# scilab_ml

This project aims to develop machine learning features in SCILAB, which will be available to the end-user as a toolbox or direct function calls. The project has been divided into two sections

 * all major machine learning algorithms will be implemented through Scilab code.
 * an integration approach will be followed to adapt popular ml library Tensorflow for SCILAB, using PIMS

ml libraries to be adapted from python to Scilab-

 * Scikit-learn
