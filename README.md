# scilab_ml
This repository includes machine learning features implemented in scilab

Models added till now:
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression  

To be added:

3. Neural networks
4. K-means Clustering algorithm
5. Support Vector Machine algorithm
5. Na√Øve Bayes Classifier algorithm
6. Deep neural networks
8. Apriori Algorithm
9. Nearest Neighbours
10. Random Forests
11. Decision Trees

.
Other machine learning features to be included:
1. Gradient Descent (seperate.sci for function calls)
2. Backpropogation algorithm
3. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, kernel PCA)


Addition of known ml libraries in python to scilab-
1. Scikit-learn
2. tensorflow

If project continued over the summer, then I will do addition of deep learning algorithms through SCLILAB:
1. Convolutional neural networks
2. Deep belief networks
3. Recursive neural networks
4. Deep Boltzmann machines
